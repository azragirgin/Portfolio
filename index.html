        <p>
          Hi! My name is Azra. I'm an ambitious developer particularly
          interested in Machine Learning & AI. I enjoy working on innovative
          projects to solve real world problems and create an impact with
          technology. This portfolio page showcases my favorite work from Year 1
          & 2.

          <p>
            My first hands-on experience with coding resulted in this exciting
            2D game. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and P5 libraries, it features
            a "princess" character navigating through obstacles to reach the
            finish line within a time limit.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gained foundational programming skills using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Learned handling user interactions.</li>
            <li>Understood basic game logic implementation.</li>

          <p>
            This project introduced me to 3D graphics programming and rendering.
            Using JavaScript and 3D libraries, I created interactive models to
            explore 3D design and transformations.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explored geometry and 3D transformations in programming.</li>
            <li>Understood the basics of lighting and rendering effects.</li>
            <li>Learned Creating Vectors, magnitudes and normalising.</li>

          <p>
            Developed a browser-based drawing tool using JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
            and P5 libraries. This application allows the user to draw using
            various brushes and tools.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learned DOM manipulation and interactive UI design.</li>
            <li>Implemented responsive various layouts using HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>Gained understanding of canvas-based drawing.</li>

            alt="Hangman Game Screenshot"
            class="project-image"
          />
          <p>
            This is a console-based hangman game implemented in Java, this
            project contirbuted for my understanding of object-oriented
            programming principles. The game generates random words for each
            session and provides a user-friendly interface for guessing within
            limited attempts or else the user fails to win.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Applied object-oriented programming concepts like classes.</li>
            <li>
              Worked with file handling to store and retrieve words lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Practiced creating user-friendly console applications with Java.

          <p>
            This project taught me how to build back-end systems using SQL and
            manage databases effectively. The forum app enables users to create
            accounts, post content, and view recent discussions within the
            application.
          </p>
          <ul>
